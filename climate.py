# ToDo: Modify temp based on altitude.  (Partially done; basic method is in place but need temps to change on an absolute scale, not a relative one from lowest to highest point.)
# ToDo: Make arrays for temperature at various altitudes? (i.e. not just at ground level, but also like the stratosphere etc.) https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/change-atmosphere-altitude
# ToDo: Also establish the latitudes of the "tropics" bands of tempreatures (low, mid, high latitudes; tropics, subtropics, polar)
# ToDo: Factor in axial tilt (tropic of cancer, tropic of capricorn, etc.)  NOTE: latitude bands should probably be defined with a GLOBAL, maybe a dict
# ToDo: And due to axial tilt, take a time of year as an input to modify values (summer temps are different from winter temps)
# Examples:
# Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
# -26 -38 -50 -53 -53 -55 -56 -55 -55 -47 -35 -25 South Pole average high in C
# -30 -43 -57 -61 -61 -63 -64 -63 -63 -53 -39 -29 South Pole average low in C
# -15  -9  -4   6  15  21  22  18  12   2  -9 -14 North Pole average high in C
# -21 -17 -15  -4   4  11  13  10   4  -3 -15 -20 North Pole average low in C
# ToDo: Solar insolation. Eventually this is where the power of incoming solar radiation would be used to determine the energy and therefore the temperature (when combined with gas composition, albedo, black body radiation.. and other stuff..)
#   (I think for that part we can probably get away with a much-simplified calculation that might be for the full planet average or only for horizontal bands instead of per vertex.)
# ToDo: Climate/Biome classifications, e.g.  KÃ¶ppen-Geiger, Trewartha, Holdridge, Whittaker. (I want to support multiple classification systems.)
#   This might prove helpful, although it's for processing images: https://github.com/MightyBOBcnc/speculative-koppen Maybe it can be adapted to icosphere, and more than 2 months.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_classification and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome
#   worldengine might also have some useful code in whatever is the most up-to-date fork. https://github.com/MightyBOBcnc/worldengine

    # ToDo: Okay, so, temp fallof with altitude is tied to humidity; more humidity = slower falloff.
    # https://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/15157/does-elevation-affect-temperature This says temp falls off at about 9.8C per km in "dry" air, or 6C per km if humidity is 100% (NOTE: This wouldn't hold true for alien planets)
