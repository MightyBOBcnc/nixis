# ToDo: Modify temp based on altitude.  (Partially done; basic method is in place but need temps to change on an absolute scale, not a relative one from lowest to highest point.)
# ToDo: Make arrays for temperature at various altitudes? (i.e. not just at ground level, but also like the stratosphere etc.) https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/change-atmosphere-altitude
# ToDo: Also establish the latitudes of the "tropics" bands of tempreatures (low, mid, high latitudes; tropics, subtropics, polar)
# ToDo: Factor in axial tilt (tropic of cancer, tropic of capricorn, etc.)  NOTE: latitude bands should probably be defined with a GLOBAL, maybe a dict
# ToDo: And due to axial tilt, take a time of year as an input to modify values (summer temps are different from winter temps)
#       The time of year should be set up that it can be any arbitrary amount of time, not a set number like 12, so that we can have planets with any orbital period, and cultures with arbitrary calendar increments (3 months, 60 weeks, 30 months, whatever)
# Examples:
# Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
# -26 -38 -50 -53 -53 -55 -56 -55 -55 -47 -35 -25 South Pole average high in C
# -30 -43 -57 -61 -61 -63 -64 -63 -63 -53 -39 -29 South Pole average low in C
# -15  -9  -4   6  15  21  22  18  12   2  -9 -14 North Pole average high in C
# -21 -17 -15  -4   4  11  13  10   4  -3 -15 -20 North Pole average low in C
# ToDo: Solar insolation. Eventually this is where the power of incoming solar radiation would be used to determine the energy and therefore the temperature (when combined with gas composition, albedo, black body radiation.. and other stuff..)
#   (I think for that part we can probably get away with a much-simplified calculation that might be for the full planet average or only for horizontal bands instead of per vertex.)
# ToDo: Climate/Biome classifications, e.g.  KÃ¶ppen-Geiger, Trewartha, Holdridge, Whittaker. (I want to support multiple classification systems.)
#   This might prove helpful, although it's for processing images: https://github.com/MightyBOBcnc/speculative-koppen Maybe it can be adapted to icosphere, and more than 2 months.
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_classification and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biome
#   worldengine might also have some useful code in whatever is the most up-to-date fork. https://github.com/MightyBOBcnc/worldengine

#   "the total amount of water vapor in the atmosphere remains approximately the same over time.
#    However, over the continents, precipitation routinely exceeds evaporation, and conversely, over the oceans, evaporation exceeds precipitation."
#
# ToDo: Not just rain, but frozen types of precipitation as well, and mixes (snow, sleet, etc.)
# ToDo: Not just evaporation, not just transpiration from plants, but also sublimation in colder regions.
# ToDo: Eventually perhaps take volcanic emissions into account.
# ToDo: Maybe an air quality index?  e.g. for tracking saharan-like dust storms, volcanoes, and forest fires?  lol, even pollen during spring.
# ToDo: I'd like to be able to determine areas on the planet that are most likely to experience severe weather (I'm mainly interested in thunderstorms but hurricanes, monsoons, extreme winds, and blizzards are also okay to do).
#   I imagine that a combination of humidity and temperature could produce a crude map like this.  Add in wind speed and atmospheric pressure to improve accuracy.  Maybe also a rate of exchange between air and land (precip and evap) with areas of high exchange.

    # ToDo: Temps will only ever be in a range from approximately -60.0 to +60.0 C, so, what's a good dtype for that?  The world record low is approx -90 C, and the record high is approx +56 C.
    #       float16 could hold that but with little precision. float32 is probably the smallest safe choice.  I also may want room for higher and lower values than Earth produces.
    #       Consider also that Kelvin and Celsius have the same unit size; an increase of 1 K is identical to an increase of 1 C; the only difference is that C is offset by +273.15 from Kelvin values. (water freezes at 273.15 K and boils at 373.15 K)
    #       So given that I might want to someday expand the planet generator to non-Earthlike planets, or that I might need temperatures above/below Earth normals, maybe I should store them and calculate them in Kelvin.

    # https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/change-atmosphere-altitude Says average is 6.5C per km.  I think the consensus is 6.5C/km or 0.65 per 100 meters.
    # It's called "Lapse Rate" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate and wiki says that the moist rate is more like 5C per km.. but the ICAO says an 'average' is 6.49 or 6.56C globally? Britannica suggests 6.5
